WHAT: Global Knowledge Hierarchical Attention Network (GK-HAN)
WHY: Large organizations need IT optimization in line with their existing processes.
HOW: Best of breed Artifical Intelligence:

1) HAN - see discussion below
2) Dimensional models to train the HAN (from corpus, manually)
3) Doctrine / Standard Operating Procedures
4) Tooling to support Agile and Lean Six Sigma efforts
5) Robotic Process Automation
6) Machine Learning - base on above modeling for 

HAN Definition / Links with Notes:
From Bing / ChatGPT 4:
A Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) is a type of neural network that uses stacked recurrent neural networks on the word level, followed by an attention network. The goal is to extract words that are important to the meaning of the entire sentence and aggregate these instructional words to form a vector of the sentence. HANs also consider the hierarchical structure of documents (document - sentences - words) and include an attention mechanism that is able to find the most important words and sentences in a document while taking the context into consideration.
